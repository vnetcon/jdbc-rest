# jdbc-rest
jdbc wrapper on actual jdbc driver for executing parameterized sql statements and convert the results into json.

Below is a simple query
```sql
select fname, lname from miki.mikitest --[json]
```
and below is the returned result as json
```json
{
  "fname": "Adam",
  "lname": "Smith"
}
```

And then slightly more advanced example
```sql
select fname as "FirstName", lname as "LastName" 
from miki.mikitest 
where fname = '{r_fname}' --[json=Person; r_fname=Adam]
```
which poduce following json

```json
{
  "Person": {
    "FirstName": "Adam",
    "LastName": "Smith"
  }
}
```
In this example we used r_fname parameter. r_ stands for request parameter that are passed in jdbc-restservelt to driver and are replaced with the values the requester send to servlet. In here we add "r_fname=Adam" as a default request parameter if the requests parameters are not avalable (e.g. you are running the queries in DBeaver).
